# Lifen Frontend Challenge

This is my way of doing the Lifen Frontend Challenge.

In order to be more efficient and fast, I used :
- React : https://reactjs.org/
- Create React App : https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- React Dropzone : https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone

### How to make it work

Here are the commands you need to do :
```
git clone https://github.com/mandawino/frontend-jobs.git
cd lifen
npm install
npm start
```

Now you can go to **localhost:3000** in you browser.
